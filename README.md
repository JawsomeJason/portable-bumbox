Taking Gaslight's Ember.JS Training project and making it more mobile-friendly and accessible.

First commit includes the finished tutorial from Gaslight's online [Introduction to Ember.JS](https://teamgaslight.com/training/courses/14-introduction-to-ember-js) training course.  I highly recommend their training, which is highly in-depth and comprehensive of the foundations of Ember.JS.

After completing this training, this project augments the Bümböx application with a mobile-first approach, accessibility initiatives, concise BEM CSS, and a migration to [Ember.JS pods](https://ember-cli.com/user-guide/#using-pods).
